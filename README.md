## Current Status

- Conceptualizing core architecture  
- Designing ethical logic modules  
- Researching blockchain integration with AI  
- Early prototyping underway

---

## Why Sentinel Grid?

- Reduce centralized AI control risks  
- Enable transparent AI decision making  
- Foster community-led AI policy and oversight

*Built by visionaries — work in progress, future in mind.*
